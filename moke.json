These Galvanised steel pipes and tubes, are used in water supply, structural applications etc.\nIn order to seek long-term structural performance in the harshest of weather conditions, designers, builders and consumers have turned to using zinc-coated steel pipes. This is because zinc-coated galvanised steel pipes and tube resist the attack of wind, water and road salts. Apart from being easy on the pocket GI pipes are highly corrosion resistant, light in weight, easy to handle during transport and easy to join.",
